## February 2026

### Session 1 (2026-02-23)
**Work**: Full research phase. Brainstormed product vision, architecture, feature set, command-aware autocorrect.
**Decisions**: Name=DevKey, Kotlin+C++NDK, on-device AI, Material You, progressive modernization, no swipe, smart hybrid command mode.
**Next**: Continue brainstorming.

### Session 2 (2026-02-23)
**Work**: Resumed brainstorming. Approved Full Mode as default layout.
**Decisions**: Default keyboard mode = Full Mode.
**Next**: Create mockups.

### Session 3 (2026-02-23)
**Work**: Diagnosed html-sync MCP connection failure. Created `.mcp.json` in project root. Narrowed mockup scope.
**Decisions**: Mockup scope = Main + Power User only.
**Next**: Create mockups, complete design sections.

### Session 4 (2026-02-23)
**Work**: Created 30 keyboard layout mockups across 3 rounds via html-sync MCP. Narrowed from 10+ designs to final layout (#8: Esc/Tab in number row, modifiers + arrows bottom). Completed all remaining design sections (data flow, voice, testing, distribution). Wrote full design doc (13 sections) and 5-session implementation plan.
**Decisions**: Final layout = #8. Macros = chips + grid + recording. Ctrl-held = shortcut labels. Whisper for voice. Local + export/import for data. Unit + integration tests.
**Next**: Begin Session 1 implementation (infrastructure & scaffolding).
